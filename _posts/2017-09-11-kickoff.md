Our kickoff meeting will take place in Helsinki, on September 26 at 17:30.
Taking the opportunity of [GBIFB24 week](http://gb24.gbif.org), we'll sit together to initiate our BIREME activities.
This informal kickoff aims to:
* share our initial views and possible preparatory work
* plan/prepare the first workshop to be held in October in Brussels
* find consensual approach on how to drive project
