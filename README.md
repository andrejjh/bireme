## Welcome to BIREME Pages

**European Bireme** project aims to study EU Nodes in biodiversity reporting mechanisms.
This project is funded by [GBIF's CESP 2017](http://www.gbif.org/programme/capacity-support).
## Summary

This project aims to describe EU reporting processes and data flows in several EU countries, investigate how GBIF could facilitate EU reporting and recommend changes to GBIF tools/procedures, if needed.Best practices will be identified, summarized and spread to all EU countries.

The project will be articulated around two phases:
1. Assess nationally how EU reporting works based on a common
methodology. These assessments will be conducted in *Belgium*, *France*, *Ireland*, *Norway* and *Portugal*
2. Compare national assessments, extract best practices and give recommendations to GBIF Secretariat and European Nodes
