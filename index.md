## Welcome to BIREME Pages

Funded by [CESP 2017](http://www.gbif.org/programme/capacity-support), **European Bireme** project will study European Nodes in **bi**odiversity **re**porting **me**chanisms.

## Summary

This project aims to describe EU reporting processes and data flows in five EU countries, investigate how [GBIF](http://www.gbif.org) could facilitate EU reporting and recommend changes to GBIF tools/procedures, if needed. Best practices will be identified, summarized and spread to all EU countries.

The project will be articulated around two phases:
1. Assess nationally how EU reporting works based on a common
methodology. These assessments will be conducted in *Belgium*, *France*, *Ireland*, *Norway* and *Portugal*
2. Compare national assessments, extract best practices and give recommendations to GBIF Secretariat and European Nodes

## Calendar
Project starts in September 2017 and ends in May 2018. Two workshops are foreseen:
1. *Defining scope and methodology of national use cases*
2. *Analysing national use cases and proposing improvements*
