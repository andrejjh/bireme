Funded by [GBIF Capacity Enhancement Support Programme](https://www.gbif.org/programme/82219/capacity-enhancement-support-programme), the [European Bireme](https://www.gbif.org/project/83336/european-bireme-eu-nodes-in-biodiversity-reporting-mechanisms) project will study European Nodes in **bi**odiversity **re**porting **me**chanisms.

This project aims to describe EU reporting processes and data flows in five EU countries, investigate how [GBIF](http://www.gbif.org) could facilitate EU reporting and recommend changes to GBIF tools/procedures, if needed. Best practices will be identified, summarized and spread to all EU countries.

The project will be articulated around two phases:
1. Assess nationally how EU reporting works based on a common
methodology. These assessments will be conducted in *Belgium*, *France*, *Ireland*, *Norway* and *Portugal*
2. Compare national assessments, extract best practices and give recommendations to GBIF Secretariat and European Nodes

## Calendar
Project starts in September 2017 and ends in May 2018. Two workshops are foreseen:
1. *Defining scope and methodology of national use cases*
2. *Analysing national use cases and proposing improvements*

## Partners
People involved in the project are:
* Anne-Sophie Archambeau, GBIF France
* Liam Lysaght, GBIF Ireland
* Dag Endresen, GBIF Norway
* Rui Figueira, GBIF Portugal
* Wouter Addink, Species 2000
